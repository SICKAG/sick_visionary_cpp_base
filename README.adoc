== Overview

This repository provides the base interfaces to access SICK Visionary devices.
Using the classes in this module parameters can be queried and configured, status information can be accessed
and 3D image data streams can be set up and controlled.

Supported protocols are:

* CoLa-B for parametrization as used by the Visionary-S CX device.
* CoLa-2 for parametrization as used by the Visionary-T Mini CX device.
* the SICK Blob format for streaming data.


== Building

The module uses the https://cmake.org/[CMake] build system version 3.16 or higher.
Beside the standard options like https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html[`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`] for code generation and
the https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/module/GNUInstallDirs.html[installation directory options]
it supports the following additional CMake build options:

[cols="0m,4d,1d,0d"]
